  bio: [
    "I'm an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Harvey Mudd College, where I lead the Zhuang Group. In the setting of a liberal arts college, I collaborate with young scientists on a range of projects, trying to understand the complex correlations and structure in liquids and to develop new tools to model them.",
    "Before coming to Mudd in 2023, I spent three years on the faculty of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, while also working as a Scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing (A*STAR). Over the years, my students and I have worked on theories of polar and polarizable liquids, ways to describe the structure of water, polyelectrolyte brushes in salt solutions, and liquid–liquid phase separation.",
    "I have also had the fortune to teach a range of interesting courses, including a one-semester introduction to physical chemistry, an introduction to computation in chemistry for first-year undergraduates, graduate-level statistical thermodynamics for advanced undergraduates, and the science of everyday cooking (and bread!). I always welcome comments and exchanges about these courses, so feel free to reach out.",
    "Before all this, I did my Ph.D. in Chemistry at Caltech with Professor Zhen-Gang Wang, working on dipolar liquids and their mixtures with field-theoretic approaches, and my B.A. in Physics and Chemistry at Wellesley College, where I worked with Professor Courtney Lannert on angry states (frustration) and with Professor Mala Radhakrishnan on likable states (binding).",
